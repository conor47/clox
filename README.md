# Clox

Clox is a multi-paradigm, dynamically typed scripting language implemented alongside my working through Robert Nystrom's exceptional book, "Crafting Interpreters" ([craftinginterpreters.com](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)). 

For Clox's syntactic and lexical grammar see https://craftinginterpreters.com/appendix-i.html.
